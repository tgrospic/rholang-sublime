![beta][beta-badge]

This is the early stage of editor support for [Rholang][rho-github]. For now, it has only support for syntax highlighting. :smile:

> **Rholang** is a fully featured, general purpose, Turing-complete programming language built from the rho-calculus. It is a behaviorally typed, **r**-eflective, **h**-igher **o**-rder process language and the official smart contracting language of [RChain][rchain-coop]. Its purpose is to concretize fine-grained, programmatic concurrency. [RChain Architecture][arch-rholang]

Rholang is currently in active development and syntax can slightly change. Current version of the plugin follows this version of [Rho grammar][rho-bnf-origin] and available examples.

Programmers in concurrent languages such as Erlang/Elixir say that one of the hardest problems is to coordinate the names (locations) of processes. It seems that Rholang with [Namespace logic][arch-namespace-logic] looks like a great solution for coordination of resources.

With all this sweet superpowers, that comes with the Rholang compiler and type checker, it will be a pleasure to write smart contracts. :lollipop:
